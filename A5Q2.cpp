A landscaping company has a crew of co-op students who do both paving and (sometimes) fencing. The company
charges $ 19.50 for paving each square metre, or any part of a square metre, (i.e. 2.1 becomes 3 sq. m) and $27.00 per
metre, or any part of a metre, for fencing. (Hint: There is a C++ function called ceil that rounds towards +8.) All fences
also have a $150.00 gate. Added to each bill is a $45.00 administration fee. HST is 13%.
The sales representative for the company has created a file called “Sep_jobs2023.txt” that contains the jobs completed
by the work crew for the month of September. Each line of the file contains the following information:
? Job number
? Fencing Job? (indicating whether fencing has been done as well as paving)
? Shape (indicating the shape of the area paved/fenced)
? Dimensions (varying number of distances depending on the shape)
